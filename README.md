 ### About Me 🚀

 Hello! I'm Rahul Khinchi, a Computer Science and Engineering junior with a fervor for DevOps, APIs, and Community Management. I bring a robust background in open-source development and collaboration, honed during my time as a Google Summer of Code Mentee automating the release process of [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/).

As a Developer Advocate at [Syncloop](https://www.syncloop.com/),I thrive on promoting and supporting developer communities. Previously, I served as a Contract-Based DevRel at [Pynt.io](https://www.pynt.io/) for the India Region and gained experience as a Developer Advocate Intern at [Onboardbase](https://onboardbase.com/).

### Current Role:
I am excited to announce that I am now part of the dynamic team at [Treblle](https://treblle.com/), where I continue my journey in the tech world. At Treblle, I contribute to innovative solutions and thrive in fostering developer engagement and advocacy.


### Communities
I'm proudly building the DeCodeCafe Community and a GitHub Campus Expert, where I actively foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. In leadership roles as a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Google Developer Students Club Lead, I've driven impactful initiatives and engaged with diverse technical audiences.

With industry experience as a Technical Writing Intern at GeeksForGeeks and a mentor at ConnectBud, I possess a strong foundation in effective communication and mentorship. I have delivered over 20 technical talks on topics such as API Security, API Development, Git and GitHub, Open Source, Introduction to Codespaces, and Checkstyle. I organized GDSC WoW for Gujarat Region in Ahmedabad, attracting 750+ attendees and delivering a talk on "Shift left approach to API Security Testing with Pynt".

### AFK

In my free time, I draw inspiration from sports, notably CR7, recognizing the parallels between discipline and hard work in athletics and professional life. As a former state-level athlete, I achieved a remarkable 11.27-second timing in the 100 meters.
