 ### About Me 🚀

🎓 Hi there! I'm Rahul Khinchi, a Computer Science and Engineering junior. As an [Onboardbase](https://onboardbase.com/) Developer Advocate Intern and a part-time developer advocate at [Syncloop](https://www.syncloop.com/)., I am sharpening my skills in the industry while pursuing my passion projects. I was selected as a Google Summer of Code Mentee in 2022, where I automated the release process of [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/), gaining valuable experience in open-source development and collaboration. In addition, I worked as a Contract Based DevRel at [Pynt.io](https://www.pynt.io/) for India Region.

I am a founder of the DeCodeCafe Community and a GitHub Campus Expert. I have held leadership roles as a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Google Developer Students Club Lead.

My industry experience includes internships and freelancing as a Technical Writing Intern at GeeksForGeeks and as a mentor at ConnectBud. I have spoken at over 15+ technical events, covering essential topics such as Git and GitHub, Open Source, and Introduction to Codespaces. Recently, I organized GDSC WoW for Gujarat Region in Ahmedabad where 750+ attendees were there, and I gave a talk on "Shift left approach to API Security Testing with Pynt".
