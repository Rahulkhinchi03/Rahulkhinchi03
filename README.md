### About Me 🚀

Hello! I'm Rahul Khinchi, a Solutions Engineer and Developer Advocate specializing in API technologies, developer experience, and enterprise implementations. I bring expertise in API observability, governance, technical writing, and building developer communities.

### Current Role:
I'm currently working at [Treblle](https://treblle.com/) as a **Solutions Engineer & Developer Advocate**, where I bridge the gap between technical implementation and developer education. I work on enterprise deployments, create comprehensive documentation, build developer tools, and foster community engagement around API best practices.

### What I Do:

**Solutions Engineering:**
- Lead enterprise implementations across multi-cloud environments for API observability and governance
- Deliver technical demos and sales engineering support for complex API use cases
- Debug and troubleshoot customer API environments, helping teams solve critical integration challenges
- Design solution architectures covering API security, observability, governance, and lifecycle management
- Test and validate API gateway integrations (WSO2, Apigee, Kong, MuleSoft)
- Create deployment guides, troubleshooting documentation, and technical whitepapers

**Developer Advocacy:**
- Restructure and maintain comprehensive technical documentation
- Create educational content including use case tutorials, workflow guides, and API knowledge base
- Build developer tools and starter kits to accelerate API integration
- Host webinars, deliver technical talks, and engage with developer communities
- Manage community growth and developer outreach initiatives
- Write customer case studies, technical blogs, and release notes
